# SmartAgriMonitor
This project reimagines the Smart Agriculture Monitoring system as a file-upload-based data science pipeline, where users download CSV/Excel datasets from public portals (Kaggle, UCI, Data.gov, SoilGrids REST API) and upload them via a simple Streamlit interface for full EDA, cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
